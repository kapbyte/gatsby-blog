Today, I had a taste of the forbidden fruit. Yea I know you’re thinking what fruit? Well it not the fruit eaten by Adam & Eve from the biblical times or any other fruit, its something even greater than that. Today, my servers CRASHED…

## The Prelude

I work as a Software Development Engineer for a tech startup in Lagos, Nigeria. Over the last couple of months I’ve enjoyed working on our project(s), maintaining & built more features to enable us reach more customers. And my collegues? They’re the best professionals the industry has to offer.

While the “big tech” giant companies serving millions of customers daily, make it a daily struggle to make sure they have 100% uptime; its always a struggle for everyone from the biggest to the smallest tech companies.

The problem started when an npm package was installed as a dependency, which technically means that the node_modules folder has changed and would need to be updated to reflect the changes made to the server, but for some technical reason the server didn’t start. Oh yeah, please don’t ask me how long the downtime was or how our servers are setup. lol

This particular problem really made me do some digging deep, and research much more about some of the tools and technologies which we use for our server setup, and how they all come together. Which did give me alot of confidence going forward. Well this was a good problem to have to be honest. Just like the local palance saying goes, `"Wahala no dey finish"`. 

But then we move on to other problem(s) to solve. See you in the next one.
